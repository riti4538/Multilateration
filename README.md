# multilateration
Python code implementing the ICH (Information Content Heuristic) approximation algorithm for metric dimension (see [1])

This code also applies to general multilateration problems (see [2])

Code implementing a constructive algorithm for a bound on the metric dimension of Hamming graphs is included (see [2]) along with functions for testing resolvability
